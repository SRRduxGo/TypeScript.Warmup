# TypeScript.Warmup

- Warming up on TypeScript

## Premise

- Writing TypeScript is the same as writing JS with Extra-Documentation
- TypeScript doesn't decide on how our code would get executed in the Browser

## what is a Type

- Type, in fancy language, defines a `constraint` on a value that a given variable can hold
- This `constraint` can be thought of set of rules
- these `rules` can mean anything valid in JS world, like what all `properties + methods` a `value` (Object) can have
- helps in knowing what set of value-types are flowing around in program flow

## Kinds of constraints OR types

- string
- number
- boolean
- Date
- Todo
